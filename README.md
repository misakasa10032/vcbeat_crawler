c# vcbeat_crawler
A web crawler designed to capture info of VC events and start-ups in the industry of medicine based upon the mini apps of wechat

This web crawler is developed according to the technique of sniffering data packets specified by HTTP protocol. And the purpose of it is to export the data set of the VC events and start-ups in the industry of medicine including the name of the enterprise, the address of HQ, the contact way, the brief introduction, the category and the field involved, the founding time, the running state, the count of employees and events of raising funds surrounding the enterprise, etc FREELY. And I have to stress the zero cost again because the official price of each item exported from the database is 0.5 yuan, which is fairly high. And you will be restricted to inspect only one hundred items if you aren't its member whose price is 108 yuan or 999 yuan per year. I believe that most people would not like to spend such a large sum of money to become its members. 

You can specify the fields that you are interested in and the number of items you would like to search for all by yourself.

The information displayed is derived from the wechat mini apps of VCBEAT.

Wish you can enjoy this gadget. Have fun.
